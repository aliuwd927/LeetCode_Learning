# Leet Code Learning
The purpose of this repo is to document the challenges I've face when learning with Leet Code
I am using this learning platform to better understand javascript
I am learning how to problem solve by breaking them down to its simplest form and attacking it slowly until it works completely
I will also be reviewing what I've learned so I don't forget.
